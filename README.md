# COSC364RipRouting
In this project, in groups of two, we implemented the RIP routing protocol on python. We created a file parser so parse the configuration files, implemented the core of the RIP Routing protocol and then implemented split horizon with poisoned reverse.
The code can be run in the terminal by downloading and inputting "RIPRoutingProtocol.py routerConfigX" and replacing X with the number of the configuration file you want to use. 
To see a demonstration of the network it is advised that you run 7 instances of the terminal, all using separate routing configuration files.
